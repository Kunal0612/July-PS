Write a C++ Solution PermuTree to find if the designed stations can meet the needs of all cities return 1 if 
it can meet the needs, or return 0.

The government of Berland decided to improve network coverage in his country. Berland has a unique structure: 
the capital in the center and n
cities in a circle around the capital. The capital already has a good network coverage (so the government ignores it), 
but the i-th city contains household_i
households that require a connection.

The government designed a plan to build len network stations between all pairs of neighboring 
cities which will maintain connections only for these cities. In other words, the i-th network 
station will provide service only for the i-th and the (i+1)-th city (the len-th station is 
connected to the len-th and the 1-st city).

All network stations have capacities: the i-th station can provide the connection to at most 
capacities_i households.

Now the government asks you to check can the designed stations meet the needs of all 
cities or not â€” that is, is it possible to assign each household a network station so 
that each network station i provides the connection to at most capacities_i households


Input :

A integer len.
A vector of integers household.
A vector of integers capacities

Constraints :

len : ranges from 2 to 10^6.
household : ranges from 1 to 10^9.
capacities : ranges from 1 to 10^9.

Output:

An integer ans to find if the designed stations can meet the needs of all cities return 1 if it can meet the needs, or return 0.

Use appropriate Error Handling using the stdexcept library for the invalid test cases.
