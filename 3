Create a C++ function named SwapandTake to find the maximum possible score..

You're given an array consisting of n integers. You have to perform n turns.

Initially your score is 0.

On the i-th turn, you are allowed to leave the array as it is or swap any one pair of 2 adjacent elements in the array and change exactly one of them to 0 (and leave the value of other element unchanged) after swapping. In either case(whether you swap or not), after this you add a[i] to your score.

What's the maximum possible score you can get?

Input:

A vector of integers nums.

Constraints:

nums.size() : ranges from 1 to 500.
nums : ranges from 1 to 1000000.

Output:

A integer answer the maximum possible score.
