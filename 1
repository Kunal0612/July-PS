Create a C++ function named Paint the minimum number of operations needed to make all the pixels in the image have the same color.

You are given a  1 by  n pixel image. The i-th pixel of the image has color a[i]. For each color, the number of pixels of that color is at most 20.

You can perform the following operation, which works like the bucket tool in paint programs, on this image: 

-> pick a color â€” an integer from 1 to  n
-> choose a pixel in the image
-> for all pixels connected to the selected pixel, change their colors to the selected color (two pixels of the same color are considered connected if all the pixels between them have the same color as those two pixels).

Compute the minimum number of operations needed to make all the pixels in the image have the same color.

Input:

A vector of integers nums.

Constraints:

nums.size() : ranges from 1 to 3000.
nums : ranges from 1 to nums.size() ,  every nums[i] should be atmost 20.

Output:

A integer answer the minimum number of operations needed to make all the pixels in the image have the same color.
