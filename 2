Create a C++ function named SwapandTake to find the minimum number of teleporters you have to install.

There are n+1 teleporters on a straight line, located in points 0, nums[1], nums[2], nums[3], ..., nums[n]. 
It's possible to teleport from point x to point y if there are teleporters in both of those points, and it costs (xâˆ’y)^2 energy.

You want to install some additional teleporters so that it is possible to get from the point 0 to the point an (possibly through some other teleporters) spending no more than limit
energy in total. Each teleporter you install must be located in an integer point.

What is the minimum number of teleporters you have to install?

Input:

A vector of integers nums.

Constraints:

nums.size() : ranges from 1 to 200000.
nums : ranges from 1 to 10^9 and in accending order.
limit : ranges from nums[n] to 10^18.

Output:

A integer answer the minimum number of teleporters you have to install.
